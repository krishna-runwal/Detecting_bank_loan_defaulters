In this project I have analyzed the dataset of the bank to identify the loan defaulters.
I have done here data collection from the kaggle you can download the data from the Kaggle and I am also giving the drive link for downloading the dataset(https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zDN2fJDLmqJ8ckysLYyeaNOKFdGFfaC/view?usp=sharing)
What I have done here , is first of all we have cleaned data followed every process which is required as deteting the outliers , removing redudancies , dropping the missing values columns as if any column will contains about 35% of missing values then , it is good to drop those columns as well.
Here, our problem statement is to identify the defaulters for which we can only put the columns which are required for the defaulters detection purpose.
Then, what we have get the dataset which is good for the analysis purpose there are columns which consists of the information of the particular documents , weather they have been provided by the user or not 
They are about 20 documents so the names are not given , so we have also done feaure engineering here so that we can delete those columns which are not very neccessary for our analysis purpose.
Then, I have started the Data Visualizations, we have stuudies all the patterns and what are the key elements which are deciding the weather the user is genuine or defaulter.
We have written the colculsion for which is : 
We observed that the data of the non-defaulters client is about 91% and defaulters data is about 8%
Cash loans is good to provide
Female clients are more than Male clients bank give them loans immediately.
Bussiness occupation type of clients get loans very quickly .
As more Annual Annuity , the more annual credit you get.
Managers get the loans easily .
If number of children is less than 3 , then bank will provide loan easily.
